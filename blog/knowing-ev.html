        <h1>Know the basics about Electric Vehicles</h1>
        <img src="/assets/images/ev-work.jpg" alt="How Do Electric Car Motors And Batteries Work">
        <p>
          The electric vehicle battery typically needs to be plugged into a mains electricity power supply for recharging in order to maximize the cruising range. Recharging an electric car can be done at a variety of charging stations; these charging stations can be installed in private homes, parking garages and public areas.[2] 
        </p>
        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>
          A plug-in hybrid's all-electric range is designated by PHEV-[miles] or PHEV[kilometers]km in which the number represents the distance the vehicle can travel on battery power alone. For example, a PHEV-20 can travel 32 km (20 miles) without using its combustion engine, so it may also be designated as a PHEV32km.[9]
        </p>
        <p>
          For these cars to be battery operated, they go through charging processes that use different currents. These currents are known as Alternating Current (AC) used for on board chargers and Direct Current (DC) used for external charging.[10]
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          The term "electric car" typically refers specifically to battery electric vehicles (BEVs) or all-electric cars, a type of electric vehicle (EV) that has an onboard rechargeable battery pack that can be plugged in and charged from the electric grid, and the electricity stored on the vehicle is the only energy source that provide propulsion for the wheels. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In 1881, Gustave Trouv√© presented an electric car driven by an improved Siemens motor.</li>
            <li>In 1884, over 20 years before the Ford Model T, Thomas Parker built an electric car in Wolverhampton.</li>
            <li>In 1888, the German Andreas Flocken designed the Flocken Elektrowagen, regarded by some as the first "real" electric car.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Modern electric cars</h3>
        <p>
          California electric-auto maker Tesla Motors began development in 2004 of what would become the Tesla Roadster, first delivered to customers in 2008. The Roadster was the first highway-legal all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells, and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 320 km (200 miles) per charge.

          In the year of 2021, the total number of electric cars on the world's roads went to about 16.5 million. The sales of electric cars in the first quarter of 2022 went up to 2 million.

        <h2>Electric cars by country</h2>
        <p>
          In the year of 2021, the total number of electric cars on the world's roads went to about 16.5 million. The sales of electric cars in the first quarter of 2022 went up to 2 million.[213] China has the largest all-electric car fleet in use, with 2.58 million at the end of 2019, more than half (53.9%) of the world's electric car stock.
